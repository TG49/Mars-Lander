# Mars-Lander

This branch contains the remnants of the attempts to draw the surface of mars with the geometry from a height map. 

The primary issues which could not be overcome:

- Planet rotating underneath the lander as it came in to land. 
- Defining a distance to terrain variable across the program. 
- The height of the terrain would decrease upon the lander landing. 
- Height changing erratically when close to the surface 
- Lander on occasion falling through surface (due to difficulty in defining terrain height)
