1. Allow automatic orientation to the current velocity vector
2. Fix Attitude Stabilisation function (point position normal)
3. Add texture to mars
4. Add orbital prediction path





For noise:
Define noise by the position of the vertex (vertex[0], 0, vertex[2]).
Give a constant offset to this based upon the position vector.

Could make a mesh class and inherit down for different types of meshes. e.g. base class has vertices, indices, textureCoords etc. 
Child class then builds these accordingly in their constructors.

	Would likely make adding a bump map to the orbital window much easier

Currently Runs slowly in close up view when landing. Also the ground texture not showing. 
	Try grouping the two objects in the window into a single struct, and building the textures with one glGenTexture command. Think this is the culprit for the texture
	Not sure about the speeed.
