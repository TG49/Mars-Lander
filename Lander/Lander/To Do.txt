1. Allow automatic orientation to the current velocity vector
2. Fix Attitude Stabilisation function (point position normal)
3. Add texture to mars
4. Add orbital prediction path






For noisy surface find the position of the lander relative to the ground. Set this height as a variable and use the -altitude + height idea to define when landed.
